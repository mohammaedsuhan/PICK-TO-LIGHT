# PICK-2-LIGHT

A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow Microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer. It is a message-based protocol, designed originally for multiplex electrical wiring within auto-mobiles, but is also used in many other contexts. The goal of this project is to implement CAN protocol based data exchange between two PIC based boards, which are acting as “nodes”. In this implementation automotive use-case is assumed by exchanging data like engine temperature, speed etc. that are displayed using LCD panels.
